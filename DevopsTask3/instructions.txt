I did an exmaple for task, and it includes all steps in task3.

1.The backend.tf is for database.
2.The variables.tf is for variables in vps.
3.The terraform.tfvars is for values of variables.
4.The vpc.tf is for Gateway and Web-application.
5.The zap_scan.yaml is for security scanner.But I think it has a little problems still.
